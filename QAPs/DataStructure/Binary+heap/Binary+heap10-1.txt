Can we reduce the running time of huffman code to O(log log n) by replacing the binary heap with Van Emde Boas tree?
We can reduce the running time to O(n log(log n)) from O(n logn) by replacing the binary heap with a van Emde Boas tree. There is no way it can be reduced to  O(log log n). Thanks for A2A.
