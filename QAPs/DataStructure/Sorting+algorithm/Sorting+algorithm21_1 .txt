Why is a selection sort algorithm not stable?Selection sort algorithm picks the minimum and swaps it with the element at current position. Suppose the array is 5 2 3 8 4 5 6 Let's distinguish the two 5's as 5(a) and 5(b) . So our array is: 5(a) 3 4 5(b) 2 6 8 After iteration 1: 2 will be swapped with the element in 1st position: So our array becomes: 2 3 4 5(b) 5(a) 6 8 Since now our array is in sorted order and we clearly see that 5(a) comes before 5(b) in initial array but not in the sorted array. So we can clearly see that selection sort is not stable.
