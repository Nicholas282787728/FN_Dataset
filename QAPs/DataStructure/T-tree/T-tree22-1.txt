What are the application of binary search trees?
binary search trees (BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of containers: data structures that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory. Binary Search Tree - Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map and set objects in many languages' libraries. Binary Space Partition - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered. Binary Tries - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables. Hash Trees - used in p2p programs and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available. Heaps - Used in heap-sort; fast implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm; and in implementing efficient priority-queues, which are used in scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* (path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including video games). Huffman Coding Tree (Chip Uni) - used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats. GGM Trees - Used in cryptographic applications to generate a tree of pseudo-random numbers. Syntax Tree - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions. Treap - Randomized data structure used in wireless networking and memory allocation. T-tree - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so.
