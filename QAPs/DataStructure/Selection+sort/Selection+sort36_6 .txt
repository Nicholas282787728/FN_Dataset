In my opinion, the basic algorithms and structures would be: - Differente type of search ( lineal search, lineal indexed search, binary search, interpolation search) - Different type of sorting ( bubble, selection sort, quicksort, counting sort, merge sort, heapsort, comb sort, distribution sort) - Arrays / Matrix - Stack - List - Queues (simple, double, circular, skip) - Tree (different types of binary, splay, etc.) - Graph - Hashtables (mapping, dictonary) - Heaps ... and maybe some other important but this is the basics... i think.
