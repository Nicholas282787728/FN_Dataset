What book/reference should I use for interview questions on C/C++ (tough ones of the Morgan Stanley type), considering I have an interview scheduled in 10 days?I have good basic knowledge of both the languages.
Well I'm no expert on C++. But having attended and successfully cracked Morgan Stanley interviews for Java developer positions, I would suggest that you cover the following topics : 1. Basic data structures - Linked List, array, stack, queue, binary tree, BST, 2-3 tree, red black tree, Symbol table, Trie 2. Be familiar with the standard sorting algorithms - quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, insertion sort, selection sort etc and the associated base/worst/average time complexities 3. Make sure you are familiar with binary representations of decimal numbers (IEEE 754 32 and 64 bit formats) and negative integers ( two's complement and signed/unsigned bits) 4. If you are being interviewed for a server side position, you will certainly be grilled on concurrency - Make sure you understand concurrency concepts well. In fact  its a good idea to have one flawless implementation for concurrent producer-consumer pattern ready. Also try implementing deadlock/livelock intentionally. 5. Brush up your knowledge of design patterns 6. Check some of the common development practices in low latency applications 7. Read up on performance tuning 8. Read up on memory model and garbage collection. Its probably a good idea to practice implementing a graph based basic garbage collection algorithm All the best !!!
