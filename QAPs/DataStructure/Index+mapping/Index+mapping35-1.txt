What's the dark side of Silicon Valley?
I spent my adolescence in the silicon valley. This is a reflection. 1. Extreme sheltered-ness Growing up in silicon valley meant "oh my god how dare you even think about drinking alcohol as an underage person?!". I don't think that's a healthy way to approach alcohol / drug issue. A lot of people went into shock when they went to college and found out that others' alcohol/drug norms were different. For some of my friends, this meant experiencing little to extreme culture shock, and possibly making a drastic change in their lifestyles (for better or for worse.) 2. Snotty-ness I grew up in an educationally arrogant environment. Students and adults alike were snotty about people who would go to community college / "low tier college" (i.e. SJSU, and even highly ranked schools like UC Davis) because everyone's parents had a Ph.D from a prestigious university. 3. Transportation Because so many people have cars, most people literally don't need to use the public transportation. I like to walk everywhere and I try to walk whenever I could-- but it feels so weird because almost no one seems to walk. Most people I knew would rather drive for 5 min than to walk for fifteen minutes. On the plus side, I think the silicon valley is one of the better places to do athletic things i.e. run, bike, hike, etc. Updated 3w ago • View Upvotes
