★What are the differences between Hidden Markov Models and neural networks?
Hidden Markov Models can be used to generate a language, that is, list elements from a family of strings. For example, if you have a HMM that models a set of sequences, you would be able to generate members of this family, by listing sequences that would be fall into the group of sequences we are modelling. Neural Networks, take an input from a high-dimensional space and simply map it to a lower dimensional space (the way that the Neural Networks map this input is based on the training, its topology and other factors). For example, you might take a 64-bit image of a number and map it to a true / false value that describes whether this number is 1 or 0. Whilst both methods are able to (or can at least try to) discriminate whether an item is a member of a class or not, Neural Networks cannot generate a language as described above. There are alternatives to Hidden Markov Models available, for example you might be able to use a more general Bayesian Network, a different topology or a Stochastic Context-Free Grammar (SCFG) if you believe that the problem lies within the HMMs lack of power to model your problem - that is, if you need an algorithm that is able to discriminate between more complex hypotheses and/or describe the behaviour of data that is much more complex.
